# What Is ThreeFold Virtual Data Center ?

ThreeFold has created the largest active peer-to-peer cloud on the planet, which can be used to run any Linux IT workload. 

The VDC is an environment to deploy these workloads in a very easy way, keeping the most popular tooling available in the market to run workloads. It offers the tooling for : 
- Deploying a containerized Linux IT workload on the grid
- Setting up a Kubernetes cluster, able to orchestrate and manage containers running on the Threefold grid (and even containers hosted on external clouds in a meshed setup)
- Storing data in a very secure way, yet compatible with the S3 standard. 

It offers the capacity connected to the Threefold Grid and allows you to easily connect the capacity that fits with your needs, in terms of storage, compute power and network connectivity.
