# Location independent Edge VDC

80% of the data currently resides in hyperscale datacenters, at a central location, and compute power is also centralized in the same location. The trend is shifting however: it is expected that by 2025, most of the data will have moved to where it is used. Local storage of data and computation at the edge will be required for smart cities, self-driving cars, 5G, IoT, Virtual Reality and many more use cases where quick response times are critical. 
Moreover, a centrally organised internet architecture is unsustainable: the internet already consumes as much as 10% of the world ÃÅs power generation today. The extremely high entry cost and high levels of dependency on power and network infrastructure are major factors prohibiting the growth of digital infrastructure in emerging markets. 

Threefold brings your data center to where you need it to be, in any scale, and very close to where it is consumed.
