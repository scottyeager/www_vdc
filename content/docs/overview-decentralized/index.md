# Decentralized eVDC

More than 80% of the cloud/internet infrastructure that exists today is owned by less than 20 organizations. This centralisation of power/ownership does not lend itself to equality in the data economy. We have already seen examples of major abuse of the people's data to the benefit of very few big tech corporations. 

The Threefold technology brings privacy by design, where all data and applications remain under the user's control, as well as sharing of the data it with others. 
A decentralized architecture stimulates equality by disabling accumulation of big amounts of data with one player.
